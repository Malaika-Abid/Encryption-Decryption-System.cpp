# Encryption-Decryption-System.cpp
C++ system for encryption and decryption. This technique for encryption and decryption gives users the choice of the sort of encryption they want. It begins by accepting a message from the user as input. Caesar cypher, XOR cypher, and RSA are three different types of encryption systems. This system is created using a strategy pattern. The user is given five alternatives. To choose one of these three encryption options, view previously encrypted data, or leave the system. If the user hits "4", the previous encrypted data will be retrieved from file and displayed on the console. The encrypted message will be kept in files.
After typing the message, the encrypted data will be displayed. If the user wants to see the message that has been decrypted, they must press the "y" key.
